# Contract Completion Flow Guide

## Complete Hiring Process: Application â†’ Contract â†’ Completion â†’ Feedback

### Phase 1: Job Application & Agreement

1. **Worker applies** to a job posted by client
2. **Client reviews** applications and can accept/reject
3. **Messaging begins** - Both parties can discuss details via chat
4. **Mutual agreement** - Both worker and client agree to terms
5. **Contract created** automatically when both parties agree

### Phase 2: Work Execution

6. **Worker starts work**:
   - Worker clicks "Start Work" button
   - Contract status changes from `active` to `in_progress`
7. **Worker performs** the agreed work
8. **Communication continues** via messaging system

### Phase 3: Completion Process

9. **Worker requests completion**:

   - Worker clicks "Request Completion" button
   - Contract status changes to `awaiting_client_confirmation`
   - Client receives notification to review work

10. **Client confirms completion**:
    - Client reviews the completed work
    - Client clicks "Confirm Completion" button
    - Contract status changes to `completed`

### Phase 4: Feedback Exchange

11. **Both parties submit feedback**:
    - Worker can rate client (1-5 stars) + comment
    - Client can rate worker (1-5 stars) + comment
    - Feedback is visible on contract page

## ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes Applied:

### Fixed Issue 1: "Request Completion" Button Missing

**Problem**: Contracts were created with `active` status, but UI only showed completion button for `in_progress`
**Solution**: Added "Start Work" button for `active` contracts â†’ transitions to `in_progress` â†’ then shows "Request Completion"

### Fixed Issue 2: Message Button Not Working

**Problem**: Message button had no onClick handler
**Solution**: Added `handleMessageClick` function that navigates to messaging page with contract participants

### Updated Status Flow:

```
active â†’ in_progress â†’ awaiting_client_confirmation â†’ completed
```

**Actions for each status:**

- `active`: Worker sees "Start Work" button
- `in_progress`: Worker sees "Request Completion" button
- `awaiting_client_confirmation`: Client sees "Confirm Completion" button
- `completed`: Both can submit feedback if not already done

âœ… All contract workflow steps now functional
âœ… Message navigation working  
âœ… Proper debugging added for status tracking
