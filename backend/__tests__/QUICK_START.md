## 🔧 Configuration

### Modified Files:

#### `package.json` - Added test scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --detectOpenHandles --forceExit",
    "test:watch": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --coverage",
    "test:verbose": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --verbose"
  },
  "jest": {
    "testEnvironment": "node",
    "coveragePathIgnorePatterns": ["/node_modules/"],
    "testMatch": ["**/__tests__/**/*.test.js"],
    "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/backend/__tests__/setup.js"]
  }
}
```

#### `backend/index.js` - Added test mode:

```javascript
// Only start server if not in test mode
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "test") {
  connectDb().then(() => {
    server.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`🚀 Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
    });
  });
}

// Export app for testing
module.exports = app;
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Run Your First Test:

```bash
npm test
```

### 2. Watch Mode (Development):

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

This will re-run tests automatically when you save files.

### 3. Check Coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

See which parts of your code are tested.

### 4. Add More Tests:

Create new test files in `backend/__tests__/` folder:

- `jobs.test.js` - Job posting tests
- `applications.test.js` - Application tests
- `contracts.test.js` - Contract tests
- `messages.test.js` - Messaging tests

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests hanging?

- Check if any connections are not closed
- Use `--forceExit` flag (already added)
- Increase timeout: `jest.setTimeout(30000)` (already set)

### Database errors?

- mongodb-memory-server might need first-time download
- Check internet connection for first run
- Verify MongoDB models are exported correctly

### Authentication failing?

- Check mock data in `testData.js`
- Verify password hashing matches your auth logic
- Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in test environment
